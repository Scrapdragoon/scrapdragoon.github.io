  <p>
    CHOICE is a Java tool used to create hypertext-based adventure games, which can then be exported and played in any web browser. Version 1.8 includes the ability to add images and choose from two CSS “themes” for export. I plan to add more refinements and features slowly over time.
    It includes an animated interface and uses bright, noticeable colors to draw the eye. 
    
    <br>It was built using the NetBeans IDE, making great use of its GUI Editor. 
    
    <br>I created this tool as my final-year project for university.

  <h2>What is a hypertext game?</h2>
    Hypertext games are choose-your-own-adventure stories told through a digital text medium. Players play these games one 'page' at a time, reading a provided passage of text, (often written in a second-person point of view) before choosing one of several predetermined choices offered to them, at which point they are presented with the next page.

         />
    <p>
        Choices are given as a set of hyperlinks, each one labelled with text that describes an action the player can take in the current situation. Clicking on one such hyperlink constitutes making that choice, and the player's in-game surroundings will react accordingly. For example, if the setting of a scene were a busy town square filled with people and bustling activity, and the player chose to begin playing music through an electronic speaker at an extremely high volume, the nearby characters in said square may stop what they are doing and turn towards the source of the noise, whether out of curiosity, anger, annoyance, or fear. The base concept of games like these is "action and reaction"- the player takes an action, and the world reacts to them.
