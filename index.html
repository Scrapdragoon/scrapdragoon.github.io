  <p>
    CHOICE is a Java tool used to create hypertext-based adventure games, which can then be exported and played in any web browser. Version 1.8 includes the ability to add images and choose from two CSS “themes” for export. I plan to add more refinements and features slowly over time.
    It includes an animated interface and uses bright, noticeable colors to draw the eye. 
    
    It was built using the NetBeans IDE, making great use of its GUI Editor. 
    
    I created this tool as my final-year project for university. 
    
    I'm doing my best to build this website!
